        This is my own personal project that was solely based on my own frontend
        skills. Even though the idea behind this visualiser was inspired by
        Cl√©ment Mihailescu's work, the coding were purely done by me. However, I
        did received some help from the internet i.e. (Stack Overflow, Github,
        etc.) when I was stucked or faced with bugs and obstacles.

          Due to the fact that this is a visualiser, the UI will be too small
          for the user to see and interact on mobile. Therefore this application
          is only designed for <b>Tablet</b> (Landscape), <b>Laptop</b> (1366 x
          768) and <b>Desktop</b> (1920x1080). For better experience, laptop and
          desktop is recommended.

          This application will start visualising from a specified starting
          point across the grid. Depending on the search algorithm that you
          choose, the application will visualise either BFS or DFS. When a land
          is detected, it will recursively search its neighbouring nodes until
          all the neighbour land has been found, and this collection will be an
          island.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          <i>
            Note: If the collection has only one node (i.e. the land itself), it
            will be deem as an outlier and not be considered an island
          </i>
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          Once the the search has completed, the application will count the
          island one at a time until all of them has been accounted for. This
          overall visualise how the alogrithm searched through the given grid
          and return the number of islands.
